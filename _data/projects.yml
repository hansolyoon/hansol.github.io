    We investigate the problem of detecting anomalous behaviors of deployed autonomous vehicles that are not consistent with "typical" or "baseline" behaviors.
    Detecting anomalies requires us to process large volumes of high dimensional data from on-board sensors including GPS, camera, LiDAR and RADAR. 
    In this project, we propose a simple methodology of runtime monitoring through "property templates" that allow us to detect meaningful
    anomalies of interest to stakeholders, while at the same time 
    reducing from a very high dimensional space to a lower dimensional space through the property templates. Next, we use Pareto frontiers to define 
    anomalous instances in the data with respect to the property.
